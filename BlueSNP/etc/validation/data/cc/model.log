Reading map (extended format) from [ case_control.bim ] 
1010 markers to be included from [ case_control.bim ]
Reading pedigree information from [ case_control.fam ] 
2000 individuals read from [ case_control.fam ] 
2000 individuals with nonmissing phenotypes
Assuming a disease phenotype (1=unaff, 2=aff, 0=miss)
Missing phenotype value is also -9
1000 cases, 1000 controls and 0 missing
0 males, 2000 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
Reading genotype bitfile from [ case_control.bed ] 
Detected that binary PED file is v1.00 SNP-major mode
Before frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 1010 SNPs
2000 founders and 0 non-founders found
Total genotyping rate in remaining individuals is 1
0 SNPs failed missingness test ( GENO > 1 )
0 SNPs failed frequency test ( MAF < 0 )
After frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 1010 SNPs
After filtering, 1000 cases, 1000 controls and 0 missing
After filtering, 0 males, 2000 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
