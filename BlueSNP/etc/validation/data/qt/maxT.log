Reading map (extended format) from [ quantitative_trait.bim ] 
1010 markers to be included from [ quantitative_trait.bim ]
Reading pedigree information from [ quantitative_trait.fam ] 
1000 individuals read from [ quantitative_trait.fam ] 
1000 individuals with nonmissing phenotypes
Assuming a quantitative trait
Missing phenotype value is -9
0 males, 1000 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
Reading genotype bitfile from [ quantitative_trait.bed ] 
Detected that binary PED file is v1.00 SNP-major mode
Before frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 1010 SNPs
1000 founders and 0 non-founders found
Total genotyping rate in remaining individuals is 1
0 SNPs failed missingness test ( GENO > 1 )
0 SNPs failed frequency test ( MAF < 0 )
After frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 1010 SNPs
After filtering, 1000 individuals with non-missing status
After filtering, 0 males, 1000 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
1000 nuclear families, 1000 founder singletons found
0 non-founders with 2 parents in 0 nuclear families
0 non-founders without 2 parents in 0 nuclear families
0 phenotypically discordant parent pairs found
Converting data to Individual-major format
Set to permute within 1 cluster(s)
Writing linear model association results to [ maxT.assoc.linear ]
