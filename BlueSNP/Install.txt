REGULAR USERS should download the latest BlueSNP R package and BlueSNP Manual (with step-by-step installation instructions) here:

https://github.com/ibm-bioinformatics/bluesnp/downloads

DEVELOPERS and advanced users can install from source as follows:

> make           # build package (copies relevant files to build/ dir)
> make install   # shortcut for "R CMD INSTALL BlueSNP"
> make clean     # remove files produced by make all
> make uninstall # shortcut for "R CMD REMOVE BlueSNP"

Makefile includes some additional convenience functions that you may or may not find useful. For example:

> make install_remote    # install on remote server
> make uninstall_remote  # uninstall no remote server

See Makefile comments for details.
